Educational java projects

1. Transactions 
   
   Using OOP on the example of classes of transactions and users

2. <h3>Signatures</h3>
    
    Determines the file type by its signature (not by extension!)
    The list of recognized types is described in the signatures.txt file.

    To determine the file type, you need to submit its full path to System.in

    The result of the program is written to the file result.txt

    You can add your own types for recognition to Signatures.txt in the format: <TypeName, Signature in hexadecimal>. 
    For example: PNG, 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A
